                            Our mission is to prevent the ever encroaching doom that is climate change and 
                            global warming. In NYC, we simply aren't doing enough to prevent the tragedy that is
                            our trash crisis. In NYC, we only recycle 18% of our trash at home only going up 7% 
                            when we're at work to 25%.  
                        </p>

                            This probably leads you to ask, "But we have more recyclables, why aren't those being recycled?"
                            The answer to that is sorting, since we would have to search through tons and tons and tons of 
                            trash, which is unfeasible. As such, we deal with the problem of improperly sorted recyclables, 
                            which is still incredibly difficult, so much so that we often times resort to burying our recyclables.

                    <p>My family recycles by separating all our plastic bottles 
                    and cardboard from our regular trash. My neighborhood however 
                    struggles with it a bit. For us, we take our plastic bottles
                    to a supermarket and turn them in. They don't have a machine
                    outside to do it yourself and it's not posted anywhere saying 
                    that you can give them to the store, so without asking you 
                    wouldn't know. Trash and recyclables end up on sidewalks and
                    streets becoming litter which is just further hurting the environment. 
                    I hope people become more aware of these actions so that we
                    can change things together.</p>

                        <p>Recycling for me is separating bottles and cans from my trash and then taking them to local recycling centers. 
                        Where I used to live in the city it was easy to get to the recycling machines to deposit the items because the machines were always within walking distance.
                        In my current neighborhood things are not in such close proximity and it feels like its impossible to even find trash cans on the streets. My building has separate bins for recycle and trash so I hope they are recycling properly.</p>

                    <p>I recycle by placing purchased plastic bottle and glass bottles into bottle shreders.
                        Of course the intention behind this responsible recycling was money. Yes, you get money out of these 
                        machines for each bottle, normally it's around 5 cents or so, but moneys still money so I did it anyway.
                        They removed the one I normally use around 2 or 3 years ago but I've found another one somewhat close by.
                        Either way, it was a good deal, where I'd make back a portion of what I payed while contributing to reducing 
                        waste. But then again, we've all recently cut down on plastic bottles given that we're all stuck inside.
